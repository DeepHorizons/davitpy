      <section>
<p>DaViTpy is the temporary name of a Python-based toolkit designed for the space science community.</p>

<p>This toolkit was born from the need to break free of IDL (the Interactive Date Language) in order to access the whole world
of Open Source and Free Software. Not only were we trying to offer a free alternative to access our data, but we also wanted to
improve how this data is made available, and encourage collaborative development.</p>

<p>We started with SuperDARN current data analysis software, which is mainly IDL based and scattered over each member institution 
(i.e., extremely redundant, with limited quality control). Very eraly, it grew to a more general space science project, including
empirical models, coordinate systems and geomaegnetic indices.</p>

<p>
As part of this project, we are moving towards database-oriented access to space science data. A NoSQL database (MongoDB) has been successfuly implemented in the current development version of DaViTpy for most of the data. We believe that the proper implementation of a DB is a very important step in improving useability and analysis of increasingly rich space science datasets. We are also striving to implement
flexible interfaces to these data where users are free to either chose specific data platforms or trust the software to find the most appropriate.
</p>

<p>This is an ongoing effort with contributions from several academic institutions. We are always looking for new contributors, there is pleinty of room to grow and improve.</p>

<h3>Code structure</h3>

 <li>
  <p>pyDARN:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>radar: radar structures/parameters (mapping, operation...)</li>
   <li>sdio: data I/O (fitacf, fitex...)</li>
   <li>plot: visualization tools (rti, fovs, map potential...)</li>
   <li>proc: data analysis tools (median filter, scatter identification, fft...)</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li><p>Utils: utilities (formatting, sunrise/sunset, ...)</p></li>
 <li><p>Models: AACGM, ray tracing, ionosphere/thermosphere models (IRI, MSIS, HWM, IGRF)</p></li>
