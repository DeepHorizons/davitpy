{"name":"pyDARN","body":"SuperDARN current data analysis software is mainly IDL based and scattered over each member institution (i.e., extremely redundant, with limited quality control). We are trying to start an open-source python module complying with SuperDARN conventions which would include fundamental i/o and visualization functions. Regular releases of this module could easily be distributed to the space sciences community.\r\n\r\nThis is an ongoing effort with no current release yet.
